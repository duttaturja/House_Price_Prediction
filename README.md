## Overview

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers. This project implements machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of house features and predict their prices using regression models. The project also emphasizes data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluation of model performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes relationships between features and target variables.
- **Model Selection:** Compares different regression models to identify the best-performing one.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model performance for accurate predictions.
